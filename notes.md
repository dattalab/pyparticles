# TODO #
* test parameters more, is rescaling not correct?
* slippery
* numerical stability; how does sigma\_n become non-symmetric? normalize!
* particle printing
* GPU implementation of naive momentum particles

# Thinking #
* Options to try
    1. smart particles
    2. naive particles + Gibbs
    3. naive particles at start, then Gibbs, then smart particles
